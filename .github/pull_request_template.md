Note that the OpenModelica workflow **does not use pull requests** for this repository:
https://github.com/OpenModelica/OpenModelica/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Pull requests are still fine for things like documentation changes that
do not affect building OpenModelica, but there is very little
documentation here.
